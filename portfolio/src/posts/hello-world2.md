Welcome to my blog! 

I've always wanted to make a site like this. Recently, I picked up React and Next.js, and decided it would be the perfect opportunity to bring it to life. To smooth out the styling process, I brought on Tailwind CSS, and to store blog post data, I used MongoDB Atlas. Making the site took about 2 weeks, and I found the process super educational. 

In my blog, I'll be writing about anything that interests me. Expect meditations on uni life, software development, and media to be posted every month or so. 

That's all from me for now. See you soon!
